# Monolith — MonolithGAS Module

**Parent:** [SPEC_CORE.md](../SPEC_CORE.md)
**Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.7+
**Version:** 0.14.1 (Beta)

---

## MonolithGAS

**Dependencies:** Core, CoreUObject, Engine, MonolithCore, GameplayAbilities, GameplayTags
**Namespace:** `gas` | **Tool:** `gas_query(action, params)` | **Actions:** 130
**Conditional:** GBA (Blueprint Attributes) features wrapped in `#if WITH_GBA`. Core GAS engine modules (GameplayAbilities, GameplayTags, GameplayTasks) are always available. When GBA is absent, Blueprint AttributeSet creation is disabled but all 130 actions still register and compile cleanly. When `bEnableGAS` is disabled in settings, 0 actions registered.
**Settings toggle:** `bEnableGAS` (default: True)

MonolithGAS provides full MCP coverage of the Gameplay Ability System. It covers ability CRUD, attribute set management, gameplay effect authoring, ASC (Ability System Component) inspection and manipulation, gameplay tag operations, gameplay cue management, target data, input binding, runtime inspection, and scaffolding of common GAS patterns.

### Action Categories

| Category | Actions | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Abilities | 28 | Create, edit, delete, list, grant, activate, cancel, query gameplay abilities. Includes spec handles, instancing policy, tags, costs, cooldowns |
| Attributes | 20 | Create/edit attribute sets, get/set attribute values, define derived attributes, attribute initialization, clamping, replication config |
| Effects | 26 | Create/edit gameplay effects, duration policies, modifiers, executions, stacking, conditional application, period, tags granted/removed |
| ASC | 14 | Inspect/configure Ability System Components, list granted abilities, active effects, attribute values, owned tags, replication mode |
| Tags | 10 | Query gameplay tag hierarchy, check tag matches, add/remove loose tags, tag containers, tag queries |
| Cues | 10 | Create/edit gameplay cue notifies (static and actor), cue tags, cue parameters, handler lookup |
| Targets | 5 | Target data handles, target actor selection, target data confirmation, custom target data types |
| Input | 5 | Bind abilities to Enhanced Input actions, input tag mapping, activation on input |
| Inspect | 6 | Runtime inspection of active abilities, applied effects, attribute snapshots, ability task state, prediction keys |
| Scaffold | 6 | Scaffold common GAS setups: init_attribute_set, init_asc_actor, init_ability_set, init_damage_pipeline, init_cooldown_system, init_stacking_effect |

### Notes

> **Runtime actions (Inspect category) require PIE.** These actions query live game state and return errors if called outside a Play-In-Editor session.
>
> **GBA conditional support:** The `WITH_GBA` define is set automatically by the module's `Build.cs` when GameplayAbilities is found. Projects without GAS get zero compile overhead — the entire module compiles to an empty stub.
