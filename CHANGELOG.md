# Changelog

All notable changes to Monolith will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`editor.run_automation_tests` + `editor.list_automation_tests` actions** — Run / enumerate UE automation tests by full-path prefix (e.g. `MazeLegends.Bow`) via `FAutomationTestFramework` from inside the running editor. No PIE, no commandlet, no second editor process — sidesteps the `.uproject` file-lock that prevents `UnrealEditor -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests <prefix>"` from running while the editor is open. Returns a structured JSON summary (`success`, `total`, `passed`, `failed`, `skipped`) plus per-test results with error messages so agents can drive a regression suite end-to-end (e.g. "lock down a calibrated weapon's data-asset values; assert across edits"). Editor action count: 22 → 24. PR by **@MaxenceEpitech**.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-04-26

This release rolls up four work-streams: (1) responsible-disclosure security response to [#38](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/38) (CORS lockdown, MCP kill-switch, auto-update SHA256 verification, default-off auto-update); (2) **F22 P0 SmartObjects + StateTree gating retrofit** — closes the same class of bug as [#30](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/30) and [#32](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/32) where end users hit C1083/LNK2019 on plugins they hadn't enabled in their `.uproject`; (3) the Phase J fix sprint (audio/BT/GAS validation + observability + spec corrections); (4) StructUtils deprecation cleanup post-F22 — the deprecated plugin's headers relocated into CoreUObject in 5.5+. Plus PR [#37](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/37) (community contribution by @MaxenceEpitech: anim graph property setter + native-component overrides + extended HTTP retry), the CommonUI M0.5 action pack (50 new actions), and PR [#39](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/39) by @danielandric (recursive cradle sub-case + walker unification).

**Public action count: 1239** across 16 namespaces in the Monolith plugin proper. Action namespaces from internal sibling plugins are not part of this release. For authoritative per-namespace breakdown see `Plugins/Monolith/Docs/SPEC_CORE.md` §12.

### Security ([#38](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/38))

Public responsible-disclosure response to a security audit by @playtabegg. The CORS finding was the only realistically exploitable item (browser tab pinging localhost while editor is open); the rest were defence-in-depth hardening.

- **CORS restricted to localhost origins** — the previous wildcard CORS header allowed any browser tab on any origin to hit the localhost MCP listener while the editor was open. Now strictly checks `Origin` against `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]` patterns.
- **MCP HTTP server kill-switch** (`bMcpServerEnabled`) — settable via `Project Settings → Plugins → Monolith` or environment variable. When false, the in-process HTTP listener never binds; the rest of the plugin still works (offline `monolith_query.exe` etc.). Default `true` to preserve existing behaviour.
- **Auto-update opt-in default `false`** (`bAutoUpdateEnabled`) — closes a small window where the C++ default (`true`) was used before the shipped INI default (`false`) loaded, allowing auto-update to fire without explicit opt-in on a fresh project.
- **SHA256 verification of auto-update tarballs** — auto-update path now hashes the downloaded tarball against the release manifest before extraction. Previously the tarball was trusted on download.
- **`SECURITY.md` disclosure policy** — published. Future findings via private email rather than public issue comments.
- **README MCP-exposure section** — explicit documentation of what the MCP HTTP server exposes, what it does NOT expose, and how to disable.

### Added

- **`audio::create_test_wave` action** (F18) — procedurally generates a sine-tone `USoundWave` for test fixtures with no asset dependencies. Validates `frequency_hz` (20–20000), `duration_seconds` (0.05–5.0), `sample_rate` ({22050,44100,48000}), `amplitude` ((0,1]). UE 5.7 `FEditorAudioBulkData::UpdatePayload(FSharedBuffer, Owner)` payload write (legacy `Lock`/`Realloc`/`Unlock` removed in UE 5.4+). Unblocks J3 TC3.19 (USoundWave direct binding) and any future test needing a disposable wave.
- **5 helper MCP actions** (F8) — `editor::create_empty_map` (UWorldFactory + IAssetTools), `editor::get_module_status` (IPluginManager + FModuleManager reflection), `gas::grant_ability_to_pawn` (CDO mutation via reflection on convention-named `TArray<TSubclassOf<UGameplayAbility>>` UPROPERTY), `ai::add_perception_to_actor` (any actor BP, `senses` array), `ai::get_bt_graph` (flat node_id/parent_id/children GUID dump). Resolves J2/J3 spec prerequisites that previously blocked agent-driven test setup.
- **`ULeviathanVitalsSet` AttributeSet** (F4) — six `FGameplayAttributeData` (Health/MaxHealth/Sanity/MaxSanity/Stamina/MaxSamina), `PreAttributeChange` clamps, `PostGameplayEffectExecute` re-clamps, REPNOTIFY_Always replication. Eldritch resistance attributes deferred to horror-system spec.
- **`MonolithSource` auto-reindex on hot-reload** (F17) — `UMonolithSourceSubsystem` binds `FCoreUObjectDelegates::ReloadCompleteDelegate` and kicks `TriggerProjectReindex()` (project-only — engine source DB stays frozen at bootstrap) on every Live Coding patch and post-UBT hot-reload. Three guards: 5-second cooldown, `bIsIndexing` re-entrancy, bootstrap-DB-missing skip. Eliminates manual `source.trigger_project_reindex` calls in the dev loop.
- **GAS UI binding observability** (F9) — 8 new `UE_LOG` sites: 4 handler-success (bind/unbind/list-Verbose/clear) plus per-fire `ApplyValue` trace at Verbose plus owner-resolution Warning escalation gated by 1-second grace window (`FActiveSub::FirstSubscribeAttemptTime` + `bGraceEscalated`). All 7 pre-existing UE_LOG sites unified under parent `LogMonolithGAS` (file-static `LogMonolithGASUIBinding`/`LogMonolithGASUIBindingExt` retired).
- **Frontmatter Tool-Allowlist Discipline rule** (F13) — `.claude/rules/always/agent-rules.md` adds rule preventing future F10-style drift (foreign-namespace tool named in agent prompt MUST appear in `tools:` frontmatter). New `Plugins/Monolith/Scripts/lint_agent_tools.py` automates the check (pure stdlib, exit 1 on violations, walks all 30 agents).
- **F22 — P0 SmartObjects + StateTree gating retrofit** (`MonolithAI.Build.cs`) — The prior Build.cs hard-added 7 modules to `PrivateDependencyModuleNames` and force-defined `WITH_STATETREE=1` + `WITH_SMARTOBJECTS=1`. The five backing engine plugins (StateTree, GameplayStateTree, PropertyBindingUtils, StructUtils, SmartObjects) all carry `EnabledByDefault: false` in their `.uplugin` manifests — end users on a fresh project install hit C1083 (missing headers) and LNK2019 (missing module exports) when loading the Monolith plugin without first enabling these engine plugins via the .uproject Plugins panel. Same shape as Issue [#30](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/30) where MonolithMesh.dll hard-linked GeometryScriptingCore.dll. Fix: two new conditional probe blocks (`bHasStateTree` + `bHasSmartObjects`) modeled on the existing `bHasGameplayAbilities` / GBA / CommonUI patterns. Each probes 3 locations (engine `Plugins/Runtime/<Plugin>/`, engine `Plugins/AI/<Plugin>/`, project `Plugins/<Plugin>/`) and honours `MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD=1` to force OFF for binary releases. `.cpp` action sites already guarded with `#if WITH_STATETREE` / `#if WITH_SMARTOBJECTS` — `RegisterActions` becomes empty when the macro is 0 so the StateTree + SmartObjects actions simply do not register on hosts without those plugins.
- **CommonUI action pack — M0.5 milestone** (50 new actions) — Activatable widget infrastructure (stack, switcher, push/pop), CommonUI button / text / border style classes (class-as-data Blueprint pattern), input action data tables and bound action bars, generic input listeners, focus management (navigation, initial focus, focus path, force-focus, focus ring enforcement), animated switcher, widget carousel, hardware visibility border, lazy-image, load-guard, common message dialogs, modal overlays, tab list. Conditional on `#if WITH_COMMONUI` with 3-location Build.cs detection (consistent with other optional integrations). Default button class auto-created at `/Game/Monolith/CommonUI/MonolithDefaultCommonButton`. Authored by @tumourlove; verified PASS on M0.5.1 testing pass.
- **PR [#37](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/37) — anim graph property setter, native-component property setter, extended HTTP retry** (community contribution by @MaxenceEpitech) — `set_anim_graph_node_property` lets agents tune existing AnimNode pins after the node is placed. `native-component set_component_property` extends the property setter to native-component instances on Blueprint classes (a long-standing gap). Extended HTTP bind retry hardens the v0.14.3 base (`Monolith.Restart` console command + 5-attempt exponential backoff) for additional zombie-listener cases.

### Fixed

- **Behavior Tree crash hardening** (F1) — Five `ai::add_bt_*` actions and `build_behavior_tree_from_spec` now reject Task-under-Root parenting at the API entry point via `ValidateParentForChildTask` helper plus schema-checked `ConnectParentChild`. Root cause: `UBehaviorTreeGraphNode_Root::NodeInstance` is `nullptr` by engine design; wiring a Task there produced a malformed graph that crashed `UBehaviorTreeGraph::UpdateAsset()` at `BehaviorTreeGraph.cpp:517`.
- **`gas::bind_widget_to_attribute` rejects unknown `owner_resolver`** (F2) — `ParseOwner` no longer silently coerces unrecognized strings (e.g. `"banana"`) to `OwningPlayerPawn`. Returns enumerated valid-list error: `[owning_player_pawn, owning_player_state, owning_player_controller, self_actor, named_socket:<tag>]`. Empty input still defaults (back-compat).
- **`gas::bind_widget_to_attribute` rejects malformed `format_string` templates** (F3) — New `ValidateFormatStringPayload` helper enforces `{0}` slot when `format=format_string`, plus `{1}` whenever `max_attribute` is bound. Both bare and typed-slot forms accepted. Catches user-supplied `format=format_string:NoSlots` AND `format=auto` auto-promoted to FormatString without template.
- **`audio::bind_sound_to_perception` rejects four silent-accept input seams** (F11) — pre-flight `ValidateBindingParams` rejects `loudness < 0`, `max_range < 0`, `tag.Len() > 255`. New `ParseSenseClass` strict allowlist: Hearing only (case-insensitive, accepts `"Hearing"` and `"AISense_Hearing"`); future classes (Sight/Damage/Touch/Team/Prediction) return distinct `"deferred to v2"` error; everything else returns `"Unsupported sense_class '<X>'"`. Replaces buggy `TObjectIterator` walk where `"AISense_Sight".Equals("Sight", IgnoreCase)` was FALSE causing silent fallback to Hearing.
- **Invalid-GUID vs unknown-GUID error messages now distinct** (F15) — 16 sibling sites in `MonolithAIBehaviorTreeActions.cpp` hoisted into new `RequireBtNodeByGuid` helper. Parse failure → `"<param> 'X' is not a valid GUID"`. Lookup failure → `"No node with GUID 'X' in BT 'Y'"`. Bonus: 4 empty-or-resolve sites also emit `"Root node not found in BT graph"` distinct from GUID-resolve failures.
- **GAS UI binding response-shape & error-text drift** (F5) — `index` → `binding_index`, composite `attribute`/`max_attribute` strings added alongside split fields, `widget_class` field added to list response, `removed_binding_index` added to unbind response, "Available widgets: [...]" enrichment via `BuildAvailableWidgetsClause` (sorted, capped at 20), `BuildValidPropertiesClause` enrichment for invalid-property errors, `LoadWBP` split into not-found vs wrong-class branches.
- **CDO save pipeline cradle/walker fixes** (F9 — PR [#39](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/39) by **@danielandric**) — Four-mechanism fix: transient-outer reparent (`MonolithEditCradle::ReparentTransientInstancedSubobjects`), walker unification (`WalkObjectRefLeaves`), `FMapProperty::ValueProp` double-offset fix, sparse-iteration fix (`Helper.GetMaxIndex()` + `IsValidIndex`). Closes inline-subobject sub-case left after [#29](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/29) (v0.14.3's recursive cradle).
- **Drop deprecated StructUtils plugin/module dep** — Plugin marked `DeprecatedEngineVersion=5.5`; `FInstancedStruct`, `FStructView`, `FSharedStruct`, `UserDefinedStruct` etc. all relocated into CoreUObject's public surface in 5.5+ (`Engine/Source/Runtime/CoreUObject/Public/StructUtils/`). Removed `"StructUtils"` token from `MonolithAI.Build.cs` `bHasStateTree` block and `Monolith.uplugin`'s plugin entry. Existing `#include "StructUtils/InstancedStruct.h"` paths resolve transparently from CoreUObject — no source-include changes needed. Silences the per-launch `LogPluginManager: Display: The Plugin StructUtils has been marked deprecated for 5.5 and will be removed soon` warning and pre-empts the eventual hard-removal that would detonate `MonolithAI` mid-build with no warning.
- **Native-component overrides persist across editor restart** (PR [#37](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/37) follow-up by @MaxenceEpitech + @tumourlove) — Components added to a Blueprint via `add_component` previously had their property overrides discarded on save+reopen. Routes property writes through the UPROPERTY Setter meta and special-cases `SkinnedAsset` (which has a non-trivial setter chain).

### Changed

- **J1/J2/J3 spec corrections** (F6 + F7 + F14 + F16) — 17 prereq corrections across J specs (9 missing fixtures promoted to create-as-disposable, 5 wrong-facts corrected including Mana → Sanity drift, 3 non-existent actions TODO'd then resolved by F8). J1 `warnings` field documented as omit-when-empty. Levenshtein "did you mean" replaced with full valid-property list. J2 TC2.16/TC2.17 sample responses rewritten to document `event_tag`/`node_name` as omit-when-empty. J2 swept of `Ability.Combat.Punch`/`Kick` references — replaced with existing `Ability.Combat.Melee.Light`/`Heavy` registry tags (verified at `Config/DefaultGameplayTags.ini:26-27`); fixture abilities renamed.
- **Public action count restated as 1239** (16 public namespaces). The previous "1277 → 1283 (+6 from Phase J)" framing didn't reflect the actual public surface in the release zip — it included pre-Phase-J counts that hadn't been audited against ground truth, and conflated internal sibling-plugin actions with the public Monolith plugin proper. The +6 Phase J adds (F8 + F18) and other in-release additions (CommonUI M0.5 +50 actions, PR #37 anim graph setter etc., F22 retrofit gating) all roll up into the 1239 figure.

### Removed

- **`Templates/CLAUDE.md.example` no longer ships** — The shipped CLAUDE.md template was a static snapshot that grew stale fast (tool list, action counts, conventions all drift). For a project-instructions file that fits your toolchain, ask your AI assistant directly. Practical prompt to feed your LLM after installing Monolith: *"I've installed the Monolith Unreal plugin. It exposes ~1239 actions over an in-process MCP HTTP listener at `http://localhost:9316/mcp`. What's the best-practice format for a project-instructions file for this assistant — `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` / etc.? Should help with action discovery, asset-path conventions like `/Game/Path/Asset`, and verifying UE 5.7 APIs via `source_query` before writing code."* — different tools have different conventions and they evolve faster than a template can keep up.

### Internal

- **Agent frontmatter cross-namespace dispatcher additions** (F12) — 5 agents had cross-namespace `mcp__monolith__*` tools added to their `tools:` frontmatter line so `ToolSearch select:` could load them: `unreal-ai-expert`, `unreal-audio-expert`, `gas-expert`, `interface-architect`, `unreal-blueprint-expert`. Fixes the F10 prose-only patch where agents were told to use cross-namespace dispatchers but the dispatcher tool names were missing from their allowlists.
- **Domain Agents Are Editor Specialists rule** (new) — `.claude/rules/always/agent-rules.md` codifies that all domain agents (gas-expert, unreal-audio-expert, unreal-ai-expert, etc.) are editor specialists, not C++ implementation agents. Runtime C++ writing/refactoring belongs to `cpp-performance-expert` or `refactoring-expert`. Generalizes the prior anim-only rule. Cross-ref in `Docs/references/AgentRegistry.md`.
- **F22 ADR amendment in `SPEC_CORE.md`** — F22 entry updated post-StructUtils-cleanup to record that the deprecated StructUtils plugin module was subsequently dropped from the gated set in the same release. Preserves archaeological record without leaving the spec contradicting reality.
- **Sibling-plugin strip auto-discovery in `make_release.ps1`** — The release script now auto-discovers all `Plugins/Monolith*/` sibling folders (excluding Monolith itself) for `$StrippedModules` defense-in-depth, instead of a hardcoded list. New siblings get protected automatically without script maintenance.

### Known limitations (planned for v0.14.8)

- **MonolithGAS + MonolithIndex still hard-link `GameplayAbilities`** — they haven't received the F22 conditional probe treatment yet. Functionally fine in practice because `GameplayAbilities` is declared as a hard dep in `Monolith.uplugin` (no `Optional` flag), so the engine auto-enables it on Monolith install and guarantees load order before Monolith DLLs initialise. The release smoke check normally flags this as a sentinel hit, but the sentinel was relaxed for v0.14.7 specifically because the .uplugin contract makes it functionally safe. Honest take: this release has been through more testing rounds than I want to admit and we're shipping with the documented gap rather than rolling another full cycle. Migration to optional + `WITH_GAMEPLAYABILITIES` source gate is planned for v0.14.8 alongside the StructUtils-cleanup follow-up.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Build error: missing `MonolithPackagePathValidator.h`** ([#35](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/35)) — Header was added to working tree but not tracked by git when v0.14.3 was cut. Three modules (`MonolithAI`, `MonolithGAS`, `MonolithUI`) included it, causing `C1083` on clean builds. Now properly tracked. Reported by **@krojew**.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **HTTP bind retry with port probe** ([#33](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/33)) — `Start()` now retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff when the port is held by a zombie editor instance. A TCP socket probe verifies the bind actually took, instead of trusting `StartAllListeners()` which can fail silently. New `Monolith.Restart` console command for manual recovery without restarting the editor. PR by **@MaxenceEpitech**.

- **Animation IK and bone control nodes** ([#34](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/34)) — `add_anim_graph_node` now supports `TwoBoneIK`, `ModifyBone`, `LocalToComponentSpace`, and `ComponentToLocalSpace` node types. TwoBoneIK auto-exposes `EffectorLocation`, `JointTargetLocation`, and `Alpha` as input pins. New `expose_pins` parameter for manual pin control on any node type. PR by **@MaxenceEpitech**.

- **`add_variable_get` action** ([#34](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/34)) — Places a `K2Node_VariableGet` in an ABP anim graph for reading AnimInstance member variables. Validates the variable exists on the skeleton class before spawning. Animation action count: 115 → 116. PR by **@MaxenceEpitech**.

### Fixed

- **Nested struct/array cross-package TObjectPtr serialization** ([#29](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/29)) — `set_cdo_property` now fires recursive `PreEditChange`/`PostEditChangeChainProperty` on every nested sub-property containing object references, matching the Details panel's full edit cradle. Previously only the outer property got the notification, so inner `TObjectPtr` fields in structs and arrays would serialize as null on save. Also wired the cradle into `create_data_asset` and `create_blueprint` to fix creation-side `FOverridableManager` poisoning. Reported by **@danielandric**.

### Credits

- **@MaxenceEpitech** — PRs [#33](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/33), [#34](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/34) (HTTP retry + animation IK nodes). Two solid contributions in the same day.
- **@danielandric** — Issue [#29](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/29) (nested property cradle). Thorough repro with the IMC DefaultKeyMappings case — made the fix straightforward.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **macOS (Apple Silicon) support** ([#24](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/24)) — Monolith now builds and runs on macOS 15 / Apple Silicon under UE 5.7. Uses the existing Python proxy as the stdio↔HTTP bridge (the native C++ proxy remains Windows-only for now).
  - New `Scripts/monolith_proxy.sh` shell launcher with `python3`/`python` auto-detection and 3.8+ version gate (parity with `monolith_proxy.bat`).
  - `Scripts/monolith_proxy.py` now declares `from __future__ import annotations` so PEP 604 type syntax (`str | None`) works on Python 3.8+ — macOS ships 3.9 by default.
  - `MonolithNiagaraActions.cpp`: renamed local `NO` → `NodeObj` to dodge the `<objc/objc.h>` `#define NO __objc_no` macro leak that transitively reaches `ApplePlatformProcess.h` and broke compilation.
  - `Monolith.uplugin`: dropped a ghost private-integration module reference after the integration moved to a sibling plugin outside `Plugins/Monolith/`; sibling plugins are naturally excluded from release zips by `git ls-files` scope, so no explicit stripping is required.
  - README + CONTRIBUTING updated to document macOS/Linux support and `.sh` launcher.
  - PR by **@MaxenceEpitech**.
  - **Note for macOS users:** this release ships Windows binaries only. Please clone the repo and build from source per `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the macOS build path is proven (all 17 Monolith dylibs compile on UE 5.7 / Apple Silicon). Prebuilt macOS dylibs will follow once a GitHub Actions macOS runner is wired up.

### Fixed

- **Editor crash on indexer pass with WorldPartition-enabled persistent level** ([#20](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/20), fix [#21](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/21)) — `LevelIndexer::IndexAsset` loaded level packages via `LoadPackage` to enumerate actors, which initializes `UWorldPartition` for WP-enabled levels (UE 5.4+ default). Because `LoadPackage` skips the editor's open-level flow, nothing tore down the subsystem, and when the batch loop marked the package for unload and GC eventually ran, `UWorldPartitionSubsystem::Deinitialize` asserted at `WorldPartitionSubsystem.cpp:507`. Fix uninitializes WorldPartition after `IndexActorsInLevel` and before `TryUnloadPackage(World)`. Affected every UE 5.4+ project with a WP-enabled persistent level and the default `bIndexLevels` setting. Reported and fixed by **@danielandric**.
- **Full Monolith rebuild on every UBT invocation after ZIP install** ([#22](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/22), fix [#23](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/23)) — PowerShell's `Compress-Archive` writes only DOS time (no NTFS or Unix extended timestamp), and DOS time is naked wall-clock with no timezone tag. `Expand-Archive` reinterprets the stored bytes as the user's local time, so a UTC+10-packaged ZIP extracted on UTC+0 landed with file mtimes ~10 hours in the user's future. UBT's `TargetMakefile.IsValidForSourceFiles` compares `ExternalDependency.LastWriteTimeUtc` against `Makefile.CreateTimeUtc`, so a future mtime on `Monolith.uplugin` tripped the check on every build and forced a full Monolith rebuild until the user's wall clock caught up. Affected every C++ user with auto-update on (default) and every C++ user installing from the ZIP manually. Fix mirrors POSIX tar's `--touch`: the auto-updater swap scripts (Windows + macOS/Linux) touch installed files post-xcopy, and `MonolithCoreModule::StartupModule` runs an idempotent self-heal that walks the plugin tree if `Monolith.uplugin` shows a future mtime (covers manual-install users). Microsoft acknowledged the underlying ZIP design flaw in [PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive#133](https://github.com/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive/issues/133); their fix has not shipped. Reported and fixed by **@danielandric**.

### Changed

- **Release builds now run non-unity** — `Scripts/make_release.ps1` passes `-DisableUnity` to UBT so missing includes and unity-only symbol collisions get caught before they reach a public release.

### Credits

- **@danielandric** — PR [#21](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/21) + issue [#20](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/20) (WorldPartition indexer crash), PR [#23](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/23) + issue [#22](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/22) (ZIP mtime normalization). Thank you for two clean, well-diagnosed fixes in a single day.
- **@MaxenceEpitech** — PR [#24](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/24) (macOS support — shell launcher, Python compat, Objective-C macro dodge, ghost module cleanup). Thanks for putting in the proof-of-work end-to-end build verification on Apple Silicon.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-04-19

### Hotfix

- **Pulled v0.13.1 — it accidentally shipped with some work-in-progress CommonUI stuff in `MonolithUI` that I forgot was sitting in my working tree.** Same #19 fix as 0.13.1, just rebuilt clean from a committed tree. Grab this one instead. The release script now refuses to run with a dirty working tree so this doesn't happen again.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-19 — DO NOT USE

Withdrawn. Use [v0.13.2](#0132---2026-04-19) — same fix, built from a clean tree. 0.13.1's release zip contained uncommitted WIP for unrelated `MonolithUI` work.

### Fixed

- **Indexer fatal crash: "Calling FinishCompilation is not allowed during PostCompilation"** ([#19](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/19)) — sorry about this one, the fix I shipped for [#16](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/16) in 0.13.0 caused the regression. I was calling `FAssetCompilingManager::FinishAllCompilation()` from inside `AsyncTask(ENamedThreads::GameThread, ...)` lambdas to avoid the reentrant compile crash, but those lambdas can land on the game thread while UE is already mid-`FTextureCompilingManager::PostCompilation`, and the engine fatals on that reentrance (`TextureCompiler.cpp:454`). Epic's own comment on the line above says workers should use `ExecuteOnGameThread` or tick-scheduled dispatch instead of `AsyncTask(GT)`. Done and done.
  - New `FMonolithCompilerSafeDispatch::RunOnGameThreadWhenCompilerIdle` helper — schedules work via `FTSTicker` (main tick loop, not task graph) and only fires when `FAssetCompilingManager::GetNumRemainingAssets() == 0`, with a 120s timeout safeguard.
  - All 8 asset-loading `AsyncTask(GT)` sites in `MonolithIndexSubsystem.cpp` rerouted through the helper: deep-index batch, dependency, level, data table, animation, gameplay tag, niagara, mesh catalog indexers.
  - All 5 `FinishAllCompilation()` calls inside indexer payloads deleted — the helper's idle-precondition is now the single point of compiler synchronization.
  - Reported by **@asafdubaaa**.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **MonolithAudio module shipped** — 81 actions across Phases 0-2: Sound asset CRUD (15), query/search (10), batch operations (10), Sound Cue graph building (21), MetaSound Builder API integration (25). Includes three power actions: `build_sound_cue_from_spec`, `build_metasound_from_spec`, `apply_audio_template`. MetaSound features gated on `WITH_METASOUND`. Phases 0-2 fully tested (28/28 PASS, 5 bugs fixed during test pass). Module had been completed + tested on 2026-04-08 but was not yet public.
- **Indexer RAM tier auto-detect** — `FMonolithMemoryHelper` now picks a memory budget and batch sizes based on installed RAM: 64+ GB → 32768 MB / deep=8 / post=4; 32+ GB → 16384 MB / deep=8 / post=4; 16 GB → 6144 MB / deep=4 / post=2; <16 GB → 3072 MB / deep=2 / post=1. Settings defaults changed to `0` (auto-detect sentinel) for `MemoryBudgetMB`, `DeepIndexBatchSize`, `PostPassBatchSize`. Users can still override via Project Settings > Monolith > Indexing > Performance. Tier logged once per editor session on first index run.

### Fixed

- **Indexer OOM + reentrant texture compiler crash on large projects** ([#16](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/16)) — deep-index batches could exhaust physical RAM or re-enter `FTextureCompilingManager::ProcessAsyncTasks`, crashing the editor on large projects (>20 GB content). Fix introduces `FAssetCompilingManager::FinishAllCompilation()` guards before each batch, forced GC between batches, Slate-safe yields, emergency pause when available memory drops below 2 GB, and honors the async notification Cancel button. Shipped as PR [#17](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/17) from **@alakangas**. Reported by **@MAYLYBY**.

### Changed

- **`bLogMemoryStats` default flipped to `false`** — opt in when debugging indexer memory behavior. Keeps shipped-project logs quiet.

### Credits

- **@alakangas** — PR [#17](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/17) (indexer OOM + reentrant compiler crash fix)
- **@MAYLYBY** — issue [#16](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/16) (detailed crash report that drove the fix and uncovered the low-spec regression we addressed with the RAM tier auto-detect)

Full diff: [v0.12.1...v0.13.0](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0)

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **UE 5.7 compatibility** — resolved deprecated API usages that caused C2220 (warning-as-error) failures in non-unity builds ([#12](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/issues/12))
  - NavMesh: direct property access → `GetCellSize`/`SetCellSize`/`GetCellHeight`/`SetCellHeight`/`GetAgentMaxStepHeight`/`SetAgentMaxStepHeight` with `ENavigationDataResolution`
  - GAS: `EGameplayAbilityInstancingPolicy::NonInstanced` removed → legacy value cast
  - GAS: `StackingType` made private → reflection-based getter/setter
  - `FPackageName::DoesPackageExist` signature change (removed nullable param)
  - `FCollisionQueryParams::ClearIgnoredActors` → `ClearIgnoredSourceObjects`
  - `GetUsedTextures` simplified signature
  - `UMovieScene::GetBindings` const correctness, `FMovieSceneBinding::GetName` removal
- **Non-unity build** — fixed symbol collisions across 8 files (`VecToArr`, `ParseVectorArray`, `ParseStringArray`, `GetAssetPath` renamed to module-prefixed variants)
- **ComboGraph log category** — eliminated duplicate `DEFINE_LOG_CATEGORY_STATIC` across `#if`/`#else` branches; proper extern declaration in header
- **Uninitialized variables** — `FVector` locals now zero-initialized to suppress C4700/C6001

### Improved

- **StateTree schema resolution** — `ResolveStateTreeSchemaClass` searches multiple candidate paths including `/Script/GameplayStateTreeModule.*`
- **UI animation system** — `FindOrCreateWidgetAnimationBinding`, `FindOrCreateFloatTrack` helpers; transform/color component keyframes; proper `WidgetVariableNameToGuidMap` bookkeeping
- **UI param handling** — new `TryGetRequiredString`, `GetOptionalString`, `GetOptionalBool` helpers; duplicate-asset guard on widget creation

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-01

Biggest release yet: +310 actions (815 to 1125). Two new domain modules (MonolithAI, MonolithLogicDriver), ComboGraph expansion. Python-to-C++ port of standalone tools eliminates Python as a runtime dependency. 14 skills (up from 12).

### Added

**MonolithAI (229 actions) — AI Asset Manipulation**

The most comprehensive AI tooling available through any MCP server. 229 actions across 15 categories, 24K lines C++, 30 files. Covers Behavior Trees, Blackboards, State Trees, EQS, Smart Objects, AI Controllers, AI Perception, Navigation, Runtime debugging, Scaffolds, Discovery, and Advanced categories.

**Standalone C++ Tools (Python-to-C++ port)**

Two standalone C++ executables replace the Python scripts. Zero Python dependency at runtime, zero UE dependency, instant startup.

- **`monolith_proxy.exe`** (473KB) — MCP stdio-to-HTTP proxy, replaces `Scripts/monolith_proxy.py`. Full feature parity: JSON-RPC, health poll, tool dedup, editor query splitting, action allowlist/denylist. Built with WinHTTP + nlohmann/json. Source: `Tools/MonolithProxy/monolith_proxy.cpp` (775 lines).
- **`monolith_query.exe`** (1.8MB) — Offline DB query tool, replaces `monolith_offline.py` AND `MonolithQueryCommandlet`. 14 actions: 9 source (search_source, read_source, find_callers, find_callees, find_references, get_class_hierarchy, get_module_info, get_symbol_context, read_file) + 5 project (search, find_by_type, find_references, get_stats, get_asset_details). Built with sqlite3 amalgamation. Source: `Tools/MonolithQuery/monolith_query.cpp` (1080 lines).
- Python scripts remain as deprecated fallbacks for environments without the exe
- `MonolithQueryCommandlet` deleted — standalone exe is faster (instant startup vs 6+ second UE engine load)
- 2 new Claude Code skills: `unreal-logicdriver`, `unreal-combograph`

### Changed

### Removed

- `MonolithQueryCommandlet` — replaced by standalone `monolith_query.exe`

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-30

Massive expansion: +372 actions (443 → 815). Three new modules (MonolithMesh, MonolithGAS, MonolithUI) plus MonolithBABridge integration. MCP auto-reconnect proxy for Claude Code. Optional module system for third-party plugin integrations. Automated release builds with MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD env var. 12 skills (up from 9).

### Added

**MCP Auto-Reconnect Proxy**

Claude Code has a known issue where HTTP MCP sessions die permanently when the Unreal Editor restarts — forcing you to restart Claude Code every time you recompile, crash, or close the editor. Monolith now ships with a **stdio-to-HTTP proxy** (`Scripts/monolith_proxy.py`) that eliminates this entirely.

**Who it's for:** Claude Code users. Cursor and Cline handle reconnection natively and don't need this.

**What it does:**
- Keeps your MCP session alive across editor restarts — zero manual intervention
- Background health poll auto-detects when the editor comes up or goes down
- Sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` so Claude Code refreshes its tool list automatically
- When the editor is down, tool calls return graceful errors instead of killing the session
- When the editor comes back, the next tool call just works

**How to use it:** Update your `.mcp.json` to use the proxy instead of direct HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monolith": {
      "command": "Plugins/Monolith/Scripts/monolith_proxy.bat",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Python 3.8+ (stdlib only, no pip install). The `.bat` launcher auto-finds Python. No Python? The direct HTTP config still works — you'll just need to restart Claude Code after editor restarts.

- `Scripts/monolith_proxy.py` — stdio-to-HTTP proxy (pure Python, zero dependencies)
- `Scripts/monolith_proxy.bat` — Windows launcher that auto-detects Python
- `Templates/.mcp.json.proxy.example` — ready-to-copy config template

**MonolithMesh (242 actions — 197 core + 45 experimental town gen)**

The biggest module in Monolith. 22 capability tiers covering the entire spatial side of Unreal level design:

- **Core (197 actions):** Mesh inspection and comparison. Full actor CRUD with scene manipulation. Physics-based spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, overlaps, navmesh) that work in-editor without PIE. Level blockout workflow with auto-matching and atomic replacement. GeometryScript mesh operations (boolean, simplify, remesh, LOD gen, UV projection, mirroring). Horror spatial analysis — sightlines, hiding spots, ambush points, choke points, zone tension, pacing curves, dead-end detection. Accessibility validation with A-F grading. Lighting analysis with dark corner detection and mood-based placement suggestions. Audio/acoustics with Sabine RT60 reverb estimation, stealth maps, quiet path routing, AI hearing simulation. Performance budgeting with region analysis, overdraw detection, shadow cost analysis. Decal placement with Catmull-Rom paths and 5 horror storytelling presets. Level design tools for lights, volumes, sublevels, prefabs, splines, HISM instancing. Tech art pipeline for mesh import, LOD gen, texel density, collision authoring, lightmap analysis. Context-aware prop scatter on any surface (floors, shelves, tables, walls, ceilings) with room disturbance levels. Procedural geometry — parametric furniture (15 types), horror props (7 types), architectural structures, multi-story buildings, mazes (3 algorithms), pipes, mesh fragmentation, terrain patches. Genre preset system (storytelling patterns, acoustic profiles, tension profiles) for any game type. Encounter design with patrol routes, safe room evaluation, scare sequence generation, and accessibility intensity validation. Quality and polish tools including naming conventions, batch rename, proxy mesh generation, HLOD, texture budgets, composition framing, and monster reveal scoring.
- **Town Gen (45 actions) — Work-in-progress:** Procedural floor plans, building facades, roofs, city blocks, spatial registry, auto-volumes, terrain/foundations, architectural features, room furnishing, debug views. Disabled by default (`bEnableProceduralTownGen` in Editor Preferences). Known geometry issues — wall misalignment, room separation. Very much a WIP; unless you're willing to dig in and help improve it, it's best left alone for now.

**MonolithGAS (130 actions)**

Complete Gameplay Ability System integration across 10 categories. All 4 implementation phases complete, 53/53 tests PASS.

- **Abilities (14):** Create, grant, revoke, activate, inspect, list, configure activation policies, cooldowns, costs, tags
- **Attributes (16):** AttributeSet CRUD for both C++ and Blueprint-based sets (Blueprint mode requires optional GBA plugin). Define attributes with min/max clamping, initialize from DataTables
- **Effects (18):** Gameplay Effect authoring with modifiers, duration policies, stacking, period, conditional application, granted abilities, immunity
- **ASC (12):** Ability System Component management — grant/revoke abilities, apply/remove effects, query active abilities and effects, initialize from DataTables
- **Tags (10):** Gameplay Tag utilities — query, add, remove, check tag containers, hierarchical queries
- **Cues (10):** Gameplay Cue management — create, trigger, inspect cues for audio/visual feedback
- **Targeting (12):** Target data generation, targeting tasks, trace-based and actor-based targeting
- **Input (8):** Input binding for ability activation via Enhanced Input
- **Inspect (16):** Runtime debugging — query active effects, ability states, attribute values, cooldown status, blocking tags
- **Scaffold (14):** Generate complete GAS setups from templates — character ability sets, attribute configurations, effect libraries, common gameplay patterns. Accessibility-focused infinite-duration GEs for reduced difficulty modes

**MonolithUI (42 actions)**

Widget Blueprint CRUD with a template system that scaffolds complete, functional UI. Pre-built templates for HUDs, main menus, settings screens, dialog boxes, loading screens, inventory grids, save/load menus, and toast notifications. Styling system for consistent theming. Widget animation support. Game-level scaffolding for settings, save systems, audio managers, input rebinding, and accessibility configurations. Built-in accessibility audit with colorblind modes and text scaling.

**Optional Module System**

- **MonolithBABridge** — Blueprint Assist integration via IModularFeatures bridge pattern. `auto_layout` action optionally delegates to BA's superior formatter when the marketplace plugin is installed. Compiles as empty shell when BA is absent — zero impact on users who don't own it.
- **Conditional GBA support** — MonolithGAS detects the GBA (Blueprint Attributes) plugin at compile time. Blueprint AttributeSet creation requires GBA; all other 130 GAS actions work without it.
- **`Build.cs` probe pattern** — Optional dependencies detected via `Directory.Exists()` at build time. `WITH_FOO=1` or `=0` preprocessor defines. No DLL load failures, no error dialogs. Full tutorial on [[Optional Modules]] wiki page.

**Skills (+3)**

- `unreal-mesh` — Mesh inspection, spatial queries, blockout, procedural geometry, horror/accessibility workflows
- `unreal-ui` — Widget Blueprint CRUD, templates, styling, accessibility workflows
- `unreal-gas` — Gameplay Ability System workflows: abilities, effects, attributes, ASC, tags, cues

### Changed

- **Total** — Action count 443 -> 815 (across 13 modules, exposed through 15 MCP tools)
- **Skills** — 9 -> 12 Claude Code skills bundled with plugin
- **Modules** — 10 -> 13 (added MonolithMesh, MonolithGAS, MonolithBABridge)

### Fixed

- SQLite multi-statement DDL was silently only executing the first statement, leaving source index schema incomplete (thanks @fp12 / ArcstoneGames)
- Plugin path resolution now uses `IPluginManager` instead of hardcoded `Plugins/Monolith/` — works for nested install paths like `Plugins/Marketplace/Monolith/` (thanks @fp12 / ArcstoneGames)

### Contributors

Thanks to **@fp12** (ArcstoneGames) for two solid PRs this release — real bugs caught and clean fixes shipped.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-15

Native C++ source indexer, marketplace plugin content indexing, CDO property reader, and project C++ source indexing. Community PRs from NRG-Nad. 219 → 220 actions total.

### Added

**Source — Native C++ indexer (replaces Python/tree-sitter)**

- **MonolithSource** — Completely rewrote the source indexer in native C++ (4,119 lines). Eliminates the Python/tree-sitter dependency entirely — engine source indexing now works out of the box with no Python install. Two indexing modes: full (entire engine source tree) and incremental (project C++ source only, much faster).
- **MonolithSource** — New `MonolithQueryCommandlet` for offline source queries from the command line, without launching the full editor.
- **MonolithSource** — New `trigger_project_reindex` action: triggers an incremental re-index of project C++ source from within an MCP session. **220 total actions.**

**Index — Marketplace plugin content**

- **MonolithIndex** — Auto-discovers installed marketplace and Fab plugins via `IPluginManager` and indexes their content alongside project assets. Opt out per-plugin or globally with the new `bIndexMarketplacePlugins` toggle in plugin settings.

**Index — Configurable content paths**

- **MonolithIndex** — `AdditionalContentPaths` setting: add arbitrary content paths (e.g. external asset packs, shared libraries) to the project index. `GetIndexedContentPaths()` and `IsIndexedContentPath()` helpers available for tools that need path-aware filtering.

**Blueprint — CDO property reader (#5)**

- **MonolithBlueprint** — New `get_cdo_properties` action: reads `UPROPERTY` defaults from any Blueprint CDO or `UObject` asset. Works on any class with a valid CDO. Credit: **NRG-Nad** ([#5](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/5)).
- **MonolithIndex** — New `FDataAssetIndexer`: deep-indexes DataAsset subclasses. 15 registered indexers total (up from 14). `bIndexDataAssets` toggle in plugin settings. Credit: **NRG-Nad** ([#5](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/5)).

**Source — Project C++ source indexing (#6)**

- **MonolithSource** — `Scripts/index_project.py`: indexes project C++ source into `EngineSource.db` alongside engine symbols, enabling `find_callers`/`find_callees`/`get_class_hierarchy` across project code. Incremental pipeline with `_finalize()` and `load_existing_symbols()` — only changed files are reprocessed. Source DB grows from ~1.8 GB (engine only) to ~3.4 GB with a full project. Credit: **NRG-Nad** ([#6](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/6)).

### Fixed

- **MonolithSource** — Improved error handling and recovery throughout the source indexer pipeline.
- **MonolithNiagara** — Resolved 5 bugs in DI handling, static switch inputs, SimTarget changes, and renderer class naming.

### Changed

- **MonolithSource** — Source indexer no longer requires Python. The C++ indexer runs natively inside the editor on startup. Python (`index_project.py`) is still available for project C++ source indexing as a separate optional step.
- **MonolithBlueprint** — Action count 46 → 47 (`get_cdo_properties`).
- **Total** — Action count 219 → 220 (`trigger_project_reindex`).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-15

Blueprint module fully realized (6 → 46 actions). Niagara HLSL module creation implemented. Major Niagara, Material, and MCP reliability fixes across all modules. 217 → 218 actions total.

### Added

**Blueprint — Write Actions (40 new)**

- **Blueprint — Variable CRUD (7):** `add_variable`, `remove_variable`, `set_variable_default`, `set_variable_type`, `set_variable_flags` (exposed, editable, replicated, transient), `rename_variable`, `get_variable_details`
- **Blueprint — Component CRUD (6):** `add_component`, `remove_component`, `set_component_property`, `get_components`, `get_component_details`, `reparent_component`
- **Blueprint — Graph Management (9):** `add_function_graph`, `remove_function_graph`, `add_macro_graph`, `remove_macro_graph`, `add_event_graph`, `remove_event_graph`, `get_functions`, `get_event_dispatchers`, `get_construction_script`
- **Blueprint — Node & Pin Operations (6):** `add_node`, `remove_node`, `connect_pins`, `disconnect_pins`, `get_pin_info`, `find_nodes_by_class`
- **Blueprint — Compile & Create (5):** `compile_blueprint`, `create_blueprint`, `reparent_blueprint`, `add_interface`, `remove_interface`
- **Blueprint — Read Actions expanded (4 new):** `get_parent_class`, `get_interfaces`, `get_construction_script` (graph data), `get_component_details`

**Blueprint — `add_node` usability:**
- Common node class aliases (`CallFunction`, `VariableGet`, `VariableSet`, `Branch`, `Sequence`, `ForEach`) resolve without full K2Node_ prefix
- Automatic `K2_` prefix fallback when a bare function name doesn't resolve

**Niagara — HLSL module authoring (2 new):**

- **Niagara** — `create_module_from_hlsl`: creates a standalone `UNiagaraScript` asset (module usage) with a CustomHlsl node, typed ParameterMap I/O pins, and user-defined input/output pin declarations. Supports CPU and GPU sim targets. Inputs are exposed as overridable parameters on the FunctionCall — `get_module_inputs` and `set_module_input_value` work on the result.
- **Niagara** — `create_function_from_hlsl`: same as above in function usage context — for reusable HLSL logic called from other modules. Direct typed pin wiring (no ParameterMap wrapper).
- **Niagara** — Dot validation for I/O pin names: dotted names (e.g. `Module.Color`) are now rejected with a clear error at creation time, with usage-specific guidance (modules: write via ParameterMap in HLSL body; functions: use bare names). Prevents cryptic HLSL compiler errors downstream.

**Niagara — System controls (2 new):**

- **Niagara** — `set_system_property`: sets a system-level property (e.g. `WarmupTime`, `bDeterminism`) via UE reflection. No hardcoded property list — any `UPROPERTY` on `UNiagaraSystem` is settable.
- **Niagara** — `set_static_switch_value`: sets a static switch input value on a Niagara module. Static switches control compile-time code paths in the Niagara module stack.

**Niagara — Discovery (2 new):**

- **Niagara** — `list_module_scripts`: searches available Niagara module scripts by keyword. Returns matching asset paths — useful for finding engine modules to add via `add_module`.
- **Niagara** — `list_renderer_properties`: lists editable UPROPERTY fields on a renderer via reflection. Params: `asset_path`, `emitter`, `renderer`. Returns property names, types, and current values.

**Niagara — Diagnostics (1 new):**

- **Niagara** — `get_system_diagnostics`: returns compile errors, warnings, renderer/SimTarget incompatibility flags, GPU + dynamic bounds warnings, and per-script stats (op count, register count, compile status). Also exposed `CalculateBoundsMode` in `set_emitter_property`.

**MCP — Client usability:**

- **MCP** — `tools/list` now embeds per-action param schemas for all actions at session start. AI clients see full param documentation (names, types, required/optional) without calling `monolith_discover()` first.
- **MCP** — Registry-level required param validation: missing required params return a clear error listing which params were provided vs which are required, before the handler is even called.

**Offline CLI:**

- **Core** — `Saved/monolith_offline.py`: pure Python (stdlib, zero deps) read-only CLI that queries `EngineSource.db` and `ProjectIndex.db` directly when the editor is not running. 14 actions across 2 namespaces: `source` (9 actions, mirrors `source_query`) and `project` (5 actions, mirrors `project_query`). Fallback for when MCP/editor is unavailable.

### Fixed

**Niagara — Emitter lifecycle:**

- **Niagara** — `create_system` + `add_emitter`: emitters added via `add_emitter` did not persist in the saved asset. Fixed by replacing raw `System->AddEmitterHandle()` with `FNiagaraEditorUtilities::AddEmitterToSystem()`, which calls `RebuildEmitterNodes()` + `SynchronizeOverviewGraphWithSystem()`. `SavePackage` now called in both `HandleCreateSystem` and `HandleAddEmitter`.
- **Niagara** — `create_system_from_spec`: was failing with `failed_steps:1` on any spec with modules. Fixed by adding synchronous `RequestCompile(true)` + `WaitForCompilationComplete()` after each emitter add in the spec flow, before module operations begin. Failed sub-operations now report in an `"errors"` array instead of silently incrementing a counter.
- **Niagara** — `set_emitter_property` SimTarget change caused "Data missing please force a recompile" in the editor. Raw field assignment on `SimTarget` bypassed `MarkNotSynchronized`, so `RequestCompile(false)` saw an unchanged hash and skipped compilation. Fixed: now calls `PostEditChangeVersionedProperty` + `RebuildEmitterNodes` + `SynchronizeOverviewGraphWithSystem` after `SimTarget`, `bLocalSpace`, and `bDeterminism` changes.
- **Niagara** — `list_emitters` was missing the emitter GUID in its output. Added `"id": Handle.GetId().ToString()` — provides a stable round-trip token for subsequent operations.

**Niagara — Parameter namespace correctness:**

- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_value` and `set_module_input_binding` were passing the stripped short name to `FNiagaraParameterHandle::CreateAliasedModuleParameterHandle` instead of the full `Module.`-prefixed name from `In.GetName()`. This caused namespace warnings on every subsequent Niagara compile. Both actions now use the full name.
- **Niagara** — `FindEmitterHandleIndex` accepted numeric string indices (`"0"`, `"1"`) as a last-resort fallback. `list_emitters` returns `"index"` for each emitter — this lets you pass that index directly instead of having to remember the emitter name.

**Niagara — Module input coverage:**

- **Niagara** — `get_module_inputs` and `set_module_input_value` now work with CustomHlsl modules. When `GetStackFunctionInputs` returns empty (no `Module.`-prefixed map entries, as is the case for CustomHlsl scripts), both actions fall back to reading typed pins directly from the FunctionCall node.
- **Niagara** — `get_module_inputs` now returns actual `FRichCurve` key data for DataInterface curve inputs, instead of just the DI class name.
- **Niagara** — `get_module_inputs` now correctly deserializes `LinearColor` and vector default values from their string-serialized JSON fallback. Previously returned zeroed values for these types.
- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_di` and `get_di_functions` now auto-resolve DI class names — both `NiagaraDataInterfaceCurve` and `UNiagaraDataInterfaceCurve` are accepted (U prefix stripped/added as needed).

**Niagara — Renderer:**

- **Niagara** — `list_renderers` now returns the short renderer class name in the `type` field (e.g. `SpriteRenderer`) instead of the full UClass path.

**Material — Editor integration:**

- **Material** — `set_expression_property` was calling `PostEditChange()` with no arguments, which didn't trigger `MaterialGraph->RebuildGraph()`. Now calls `PostEditChangeProperty(FPropertyChangedEvent(Prop))` with the actual property — changes reflect in the editor display without a manual recompile.
- **Material** — `build_material_graph` now auto-recompiles on success. Response includes `"recompiled": true`.
- **Material** — `delete_expression`, `connect_expressions`, and `disconnect_expression` now wrap operations in `PreEditChange`/`PostEditChange` for correct undo history and editor update.
- **Material** — `set_material_property`, `create_material`, `delete_expression`, and `connect_expressions` now call `Mat->PreEditChange(nullptr)` + `Mat->PostEditChange()` to push changes through the material graph system.
- **Material** — `disconnect_expression`: added optional `input_name`/`output_name` params for targeted disconnection. Previously always disconnected all connections on the expression — now supports disconnecting a specific pin pair while leaving others intact.

**Blueprint:**

- **Blueprint** — `add_node` now resolves common node class aliases (`CallFunction`, `VariableGet`, `VariableSet`, `Branch`, `Sequence`, `ForEach`) and automatically tries the `K2_` prefix for function call nodes when the bare name doesn't resolve. Previously failed with a class-not-found error on all common node types.

**Core — Asset loading:**

- **Core** — `LoadAssetByPath` now queries `IAssetRegistry::GetAssetByObjectPath()` + `FAssetData::GetAsset()` first, falling back to `StaticLoadObject` only if the Asset Registry has no record. Prevents stale `RF_Standalone` ghost objects from shadowing assets that were deleted and recreated in the same editor session.

### Changed

- **Blueprint** — Action count 6 → 46. Module refactored from one file into six focused source files: Actions (core read), Variables, Components, Graph, Nodes, Compile.
- **Niagara** — Action count 41 → 47. Added `set_system_property`, `set_static_switch_value`, `list_module_scripts`, `list_renderer_properties`, `get_system_diagnostics`, `create_module_from_hlsl`, `create_function_from_hlsl`. Param aliases added (`module_node`/`module_name`/`module`, `input`/`input_name`, `property`/`property_name`, `class`/`renderer_class`/`renderer_type`).
- **Total** — Action count 177 → 218

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_value`, `set_module_input_binding`, and `set_curve_value` silently defaulted to `GetFloatDef()` when input name didn't match any module input, creating orphaned override entries in the parameter map that cannot be removed. Now returns an error with the list of valid input names. Common trigger: CamelCase names vs spaced names (e.g. `LifetimeMin` vs `Lifetime Min`). (Thanks [@playtabegg](https://github.com/playtabegg) — [#2](https://github.com/tumourlove/monolith/pull/2))

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-11

Niagara write testing: all 41 actions verified. 12 bugs found and fixed, plus a major improvement to `get_module_inputs`.

### Fixed

- **CRASH: Niagara** — `GetAssetPath` infinite recursion: fallback called itself instead of reading `system_path`. Crashed `create_system_from_spec` and any action using `system_path` param
- **CRASH: Niagara** — `HandleCreateSystem` used raw `NewObject<UNiagaraSystem>` without initialization. `AddEmitterHandle` crashed with array-out-of-bounds on the uninitialized system. Fixed: calls `UNiagaraSystemFactoryNew::InitializeSystem()` after creation
- **CRASH: Niagara** — `HandleAddEmitter` crashed when emitter asset had no versions. Added version count guard before `AddEmitterHandle`
- **CRASH: Niagara** — `set_module_input_di` crashed with assertion `OverridePin.LinkedTo.Num() == 0` when pin already had links. Added `BreakAllPinLinks()` guard before `SetDataInterfaceValueForFunctionInput`
- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_di` accepted nonexistent input names silently. Now validates input exists using full engine input enumeration
- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_di` accepted non-DataInterface types (e.g. setting a curve DI on a Vector3f input). Now validates `IsDataInterface()` on the input type
- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_di` `config` param was parsed as string, not JSON object. Now accepts both JSON object (correct) and string (legacy)
- **Niagara** — `get_module_inputs` only returned static switch pins from the FunctionCall node. Now uses `FNiagaraStackGraphUtilities::GetStackFunctionInputs` with `FCompileConstantResolver` to return ALL inputs (floats, vectors, colors, DIs, enums, bools, positions, quaternions)
- **Niagara** — `GetStackFunctionInputOverridePin` helper only searched FunctionCall node pins. Now also walks upstream to ParameterMapSet override node (mirrors engine logic), so `has_override` correctly detects data input overrides
- **Niagara** — `get_module_inputs` returned `Module.`-prefixed names (e.g. `Module.Gravity`). Now strips prefix for consistency with write actions. Write actions accept both short and prefixed names
- **Niagara** — `batch_execute` dispatch table was missing 8 write ops: `remove_user_parameter`, `set_parameter_default`, `set_module_input_di`, `set_curve_value`, `reorder_emitters`, `duplicate_emitter`, `set_renderer_binding`, `request_compile`
- **Niagara** — `FindEmitterHandleIndex` auto-selected the only emitter even when a specific non-matching name was passed. Now only auto-selects when caller passes an empty string
- **Niagara** — `set_module_input_value` and `set_curve_value` didn't break existing pin links before setting literal values. Added `BreakAllPinLinks()` guard so literal values take effect when overriding a previous binding

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-10

- **Animation** — State machine names stripped of `\n` suffix
- **Animation** — `get_state_info` now validates required params (`machine_name`, `state_name`)
- **Animation** — State machine matching changed from fuzzy `Contains()` to exact match
- **Animation** — `get_nodes` now accepts optional `graph_name` filter

### Changed

- **Total** — Action count 133 → 177

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-10

MCP tool discovery fix — tools now register natively in Claude Code's ToolSearch.

### Fixed

- **MCP** — Tool names changed from dot notation (`material.query`) to underscore (`material_query`). Dots in tool names broke Claude Code's `mcp__server__tool` name mapping, causing silent registration failure. Legacy `.query` names still accepted for backwards compatibility via curl.
- **MCP** — Protocol version negotiation: server now echoes back the client's requested version (`2024-11-05` or `2025-03-26`) instead of always returning `2025-03-26`.

### Changed

- **Docs** — All documentation, skills, wiki, templates, and CLAUDE.md updated to use underscore tool naming.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-10

Material Wave 2: Full material CRUD coverage with 11 new write actions. Critical updater fix.

### Added

- **Material** — `set_expression_property` action: set properties on expression nodes (e.g., DefaultValue)
- **Material** — `connect_expressions` action: wire expression outputs to inputs or material property inputs

### Fixed

- **Material** — `build_material_graph` class lookup: `FindObject<UClass>` → `FindFirstObject<UClass>` with U-prefix fallback. Short names like "Constant" now resolve correctly
- **Material** — `disconnect_expression` now disconnects material output pins (was only checking expr→expr, missing expr→material property)
- **CRITICAL: Auto-Updater** — Hot-swap script was deleting `Saved/` directory (containing EngineSource.db 1.8GB and ProjectIndex.db). Fixed: swap script and C++ template now preserve `Saved/` alongside `.git`

### Changed

- **Material** — Action count 14 → 25
- **Total** — Action count 122 → 133

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-09

Wave 2: Blueprint expansion, Material export controls, Niagara HLSL auto-compile, and discover param schemas.

### Added

- **Blueprint** — `get_graph_summary` action: lightweight graph overview (id/class/title + exec connections only, ~10KB vs 172KB)
- **Blueprint** — `get_graph_data` now accepts optional `node_class_filter` param
- **Material** — `export_material_graph` now accepts `include_properties` (bool) and `include_positions` (bool) params
- **Material** — `get_thumbnail` now accepts `save_to_file` (bool) param
- **All** — Per-action param schemas in `monolith_discover()` output — all 122 actions now self-document their params

### Fixed

- **Blueprint** — `get_variables` now reads default values from CDO (was always empty)
- **Blueprint** — BlueprintIndexer CDO fix — same default value extraction applied to indexer
- **Niagara** — `get_compiled_gpu_hlsl` auto-compiles system if HLSL not available
- **Niagara** — `User.` prefix now stripped in `get_parameter_value`, `trace_parameter_binding`, `remove_user_parameter`, `set_parameter_default`

### Changed

- **Blueprint** — Action count 5 -> 6
- **Total** — Action count 121 -> 122

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-09

Indexer reliability, Niagara usability, and Animation accuracy fixes.

### Fixed

- **Indexer** — Auto-index deferred to `IAssetRegistry::OnFilesLoaded()` — was running too early, only indexing 193 of 9560 assets
- **Indexer** — Sanity check: if fewer than 500 assets indexed, skip writing `last_full_index` so next launch retries
- **Indexer** — `bIsIndexing` reset in `Deinitialize()` to prevent stuck flag across editor sessions
- **Indexer** — Index DB changed from WAL to DELETE journal mode
- **Niagara** — `trace_parameter_binding` missing OR fallback for `User.` prefix
- **Niagara** — `get_di_functions` reversed class name pattern — now tries `UNiagaraDataInterface<Name>`
- **Niagara** — `batch_execute` had 3 op name mismatches — old names kept as aliases
- **Animation** — State machine names stripped of `\n` suffix (clean names like "InAir" instead of "InAir\nState Machine")
- **Animation** — `get_state_info` now validates required params (`machine_name`, `state_name`)
- **Animation** — State machine matching changed from fuzzy `Contains()` to exact match

### Added

- **Niagara** — `list_emitters` action: returns emitter names, index, enabled, sim_target, renderer_count
- **Niagara** — `list_renderers` action: returns renderer class, index, enabled, material
- **Niagara** — All actions now accept `asset_path` (preferred) with `system_path` as backward-compat alias
- **Niagara** — `duplicate_emitter` accepts `emitter` as alias for `source_emitter`
- **Niagara** — `set_curve_value` accepts `module_node` as alias for `module`
- **Animation** — `get_nodes` now accepts optional `graph_name` filter (makes `get_blend_nodes` redundant for filtered queries)

### Changed

- **Niagara** — Action count 39 → 41
- **Total** — Action count 119 → 121

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-08

Auto-updater rewrite — fixes all swap script failures on Windows.

### Fixed

- **Auto-Updater** — Swap script now polls `tasklist` for `UnrealEditor.exe` instead of a cosmetic 10-second countdown (was launching before editor fully exited)
- **Auto-Updater** — `errorlevel` check after retry rename was unreachable due to cmd.exe resetting `%ERRORLEVEL%` on closing `)` — replaced with `goto` pattern
- **Auto-Updater** — Launcher script now uses outer-double-quote trick for `cmd /c` paths with spaces (e.g. paths under `Documents\Unreal Projects\...`)
- **Auto-Updater** — Switched from `ren` (bare filename only) to `move` (full path support) for plugin folder rename
- **Auto-Updater** — Retry now cleans stale backup before re-attempting rename
- **Auto-Updater** — Rollback on failed xcopy now removes partial destination before restoring backup
- **Auto-Updater** — Added `/h` flag to primary xcopy to include hidden-attribute files
- **Auto-Updater** — Enabled `DelayedExpansion` for correct variable expansion inside `if` blocks

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-08

Source indexer overhaul and auto-updater improvements.

### Fixed

- **Source Indexer** — UE macros (UCLASS, ENGINE_API, GENERATED_BODY) now stripped before tree-sitter parsing, fixing class hierarchy and inheritance resolution
- **Source Indexer** — Class definitions increased from ~0 to 62,059; inheritance links from ~0 to 37,010
- **Source Indexer** — `read_source members_only` now returns class members correctly
- **Source Indexer** — `get_class_hierarchy` ancestor traversal now works
- **MonolithSource** — `get_class_hierarchy` accepts both `symbol` and `class_name` params (was inconsistent)

### Added

- **Source Indexer** — UE macro preprocessor (`ue_preprocessor.py`) with balanced-paren stripping for UCLASS/USTRUCT/UENUM/UINTERFACE
- **Source Indexer** — `--clean` flag for `__main__.py` to delete DB before reindexing
- **Source Indexer** — Diagnostic output after indexing (definitions, forward decls, inheritance stats)
- **Auto-Updater** — Release notes now shown in update notification toast and logged to Output Log

### Changed

- **Source Indexer** — `reference_builder.py` now preprocesses source before tree-sitter parsing

### Important

- **You MUST delete your existing source database and reindex** after updating to 0.2.0. The old database has empty class hierarchy data. Delete the `.db` file in your Saved/Monolith/ directory and run the indexer with `--clean`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-07

- **MonolithEditor** — Auto hot-swap on editor exit (stages update, swaps on close)
- **MonolithEditor** — Re-index buttons in Project Settings UI
- **MonolithEditor** — Improved Live Coding integration with compile output capture, time-windowed errors, category filtering
- **unreal-build skill** — Smart build decision-making guide (Live Coding vs full rebuild)
- **Logging** — 80% reduction in Log-level noise across all modules (kept Warnings/Errors, demoted routine logs to Verbose)
- **README** — Complete rewrite with Installation for Dummies walkthrough

### Fixed

- HTTP body null-termination causing malformed JSON-RPC responses
- Niagara graph traversal crash when accessing emitter shared graphs
- Niagara emitter lookup failures — added case-insensitive matching with fallbacks
- Source DB WAL journal mode causing lock contention — switched to DELETE mode
- SQL schema creation with nested BEGIN/END depth tracking for triggers
- Reindex dispatch — switched from `FindFunctionByName` to `StartFullIndex` with UFUNCTION
- Asset loading crash from `FastGetAsset` on background thread — removed unsafe call
- Animation `remove_bone_track` — now uses `RemoveBoneCurve(FName)` per bone with child traversal
- MonolithIndex `last_full_index` — added `WriteMeta()` call, guarded with `!bShouldStop`
- Niagara `move_module` — rewires stack-flow pins only, preserves override inputs
- Editor `get_build_errors` — uses `ELogVerbosity` enum instead of substring matching
- MonolithIndex SQL injection — all 13 insert methods converted to `FSQLitePreparedStatement`
- Animation modules using `LogTemp` instead of `LogMonolith`
- Editor `CachedLogCapture` dangling pointer — added `ClearCachedLogCapture()` in `ShutdownModule`
- MonolithSource vestigial outer module — flattened structure, deleted stub
- Session expiry / reconnection issues — removed session tracking entirely (server is stateless)
- Claude tools failing on first invocation — fixed transport type in `.mcp.json` (`"http"` -> `"streamableHttp"`) and fixed MonolithSource stub not registering actions
